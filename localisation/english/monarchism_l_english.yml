 monarchism_political.1.t:0 "Monarchism on the Rise"
 monarchism_political.1.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe monarchist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 monarchism_political.1.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 monarchism_political.1.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a non-aligned coup."
 monarchism_political.1.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 monarchism_political.1.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a non-aligned coup."
 monarchism_political.2.t:0 "Monarchist Militias Form"
 monarchism_political.2.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in monarchism. In parallel with its growing political movement, the monarchist and centrist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against what they see as internal and external threats. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our own armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of monarchism are beginning to look very much alike."
 monarchism_political.2.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 monarchism_political.3.t:0 "The Threat of Extremism"
 monarchism_political.3.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of extremist ideologies, willing to tear apart our nation in the name of their foolish beliefs. Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the centrist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of extremist nations. Many moderates who might normally dismiss centrist monarchism as weak ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the extremism of our neighbors and a centrist monarchist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 monarchism_political.3.a:0 "We will not give in to the extremist ideologues!"
 monarchism_political.4.t:0 "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
 monarchism_political.4.d:0 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] centrist and monarchist movements have never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many centrists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the monarchists or centrists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 monarchism_political.4.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 monarchism_political.4.b:0 "Don't pay any attention to them."
 monarchism_political.4.c:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 monarchism_political.5.t:0 "Monarchists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 monarchism_political.5.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the monarchists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 monarchism_political.5.a:0 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 monarchism_political.5.b:0 "The time of the [Root.GetRulingParty] over [Root.GetName] is finished!"
 monarchism_political.6.t:0 "Monarchists Ridiculed"
 monarchism_political.6.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and the power of the state appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] centrist monarchism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, weak position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 monarchism_political.6.a:0 "What a bunch of clowns."

For their own sake, we must force the matter swiftly, even if some may lose their lives in the process. Unlike a peaceful referendum, a civil war will cause tremendous devastation to our armed forces and the country's industry and infrastructure, but it is also quicker, and ensures we will be able to force our will through more forcefully afterwards."
