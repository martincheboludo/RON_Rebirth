Submitted designs and drawings of the vehicle went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. The tank was planned to be 1000 tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII 'Maus', the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes). The project gained the approval of Adolf Hitler, who had expressed interest in the development of the tank, but was cancelled by Minister of Armaments Albert Speer in early 1943."

First deployed by the Byzantine Greeks in the 1st century AD, flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I, and more widely in World War II as a tactical siege weapon against fortifications. Most military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either gasoline or diesel, but commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane; gases are safer in peacetime applications, because their flames have less mass flow rate and dissipate faster, and often are easier to extinguish when necessary."

Four government research establishments (STA, ENT, Puteaux and CTV) proposed over 20 prototypes."
 FRA_early_infantry_equipment_1890:0 "Mle 1886 M93 Lebel"
 FRA_early_infantry_equipment_1890_desc:0 "The Lebel Model 1886 rifle is an 8mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The Lebel rifle was the basic weapon of French infantry throughout World War I. Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916."

Named after its inventor, André Berthier, a French civilian engineer in the Algerian railways, the Berthier's three-shot vertical-feed Mannlicher-type en bloc magazine could be loaded by clips, greatly increasing reloading speed, a particular convenience for cavalry and other mounted troops."

 FRA_early_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "At the outbreak of World War I, the Model 1907 Berthier rifle was modified for mass manufacturing, resulting in the Mdle 07/15. The sights, barrel band, and stacking hook were simplified to increase the rate of production. While the original 1907 rifle incorporated a cruciform bayonet, the 07/15 was modified to take the same bayonet as the Lebel, simplifying supply. The turned-down bolt handle was changed to a simpler straight bolt."
 FRA_early_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Modèle 1907/15 M16"
 FRA_early_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "During World War I, it was quickly recognized that the Berthier's three-shot magazine was simply too small in comparison to foreign weapons, requiring too-frequent reloading. Additionally, it was found that trench mud and grit could enter the weapon through the opening in the bottom of the magazine. To correct these issues, the Model 1916 Berthier rifle was introduced with a five-round en-bloc clip. This improved 5-shot design was then fitted to existing rifle and carbine-length Berthier models, and referred to as Mle 1907/15 M16."

Some 416 were in service at the beginning of the World War I. Its mobility, which allowed it to be deployed as medium artillery, and fairly heavy shell gave the German army a firepower advantage in the early battles as the French and British armies lacked an equivalent. Japan would import these guns for use during the Russo-Japanese War."

The C/80 used a rounded breech block to avoid the stress fractures which caused catastrophic failures in earlier guns. The C/80 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns. Japan would later import this gun and employ it during the Russo-Japanese War."

 SOV_early_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Fedorov Avtomat or FA is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon. In 1913, Captain V. Fedorov submitted a prototype automatic rifle with a stripper clip-fed fixed magazine, which due to wartime expediency was adapted into a semi-automatic rifle design chambered for his own experimental rimless 6.5 mm cartridge, called the 6.5mm Fedorov."
 SOV_early_infantry_equipment_2:0 "FA Arisaka"
 SOV_early_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Production of the new cartridge for the FA was untenable, so the rifle was converted to use the Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka ammunition which was in abundance, having been purchased from Japan and Great Britain along with Arisaka rifles. Russia possessed over 400 million cartridges of 6.5×50mm Arisaka during the early part of the Great War."
